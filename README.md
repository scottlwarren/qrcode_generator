Generate QR Codes using rshiny


This repo is designed as a quick fix for a common problem experienced at work: Creating QR codes for comms, info and other uses.
Some staff have been using QR codes from online sources that expire/track after use, so in order to create a more permanent solution, I created an R Shiny app which can be hosted on shinyapps.io to generate QR codes.

While still public, everything runs in R, is open source, and most importantly does not expire.
